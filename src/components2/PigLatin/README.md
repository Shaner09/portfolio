# Kenzie Academy Challenge: Pig Latin

Follow the instructions provided on `my.kenzie.academy` for this challenge. The `code.js` file is a placeholder. Feel free to rename it or add additional files to the project.

Customize this README.md however you want to turn it into documentation for your project (including deleting these opening paragraphs). The only required section is **Reflection**, but if you used a unit testing framework, also fill in the **Running the Unit Tests** section. Be sure to use proper Markdown syntax in this file (here's a [cheatsheet PDF](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) of the basic syntax).

## Running the Unit Tests

_(Instructions for how to install the unit testing framework and run the unit tests.)_

## Reflection

For a software developer, what are the benefits of good unit tests? Are there any drawbacks to writing unit tests?

Reflection: Unit tests can be very helpful. Unit tests can save time and catch errors that you might overlook otherwise. I think they are more helpful for debugging/modifying an app than they are when creating the app sometimes. On a small-scale app like this, It is easy to spend more time creating the tests than the time that they end up saving you. Also, if you write your tests wrong, It could mess you up by having you think your function is failing when in reality, it isn't.
